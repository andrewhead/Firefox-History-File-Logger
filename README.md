# Search Task Helper

A Firefox addon that listens to and reports search behavior.

Note that in the future this project could / should be implemented with the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), which will allow cross-browser compatibility.
For the sake of convenience and familiarity, I have currently implemented it with the [Firefox Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).
